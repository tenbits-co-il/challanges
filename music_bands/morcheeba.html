        Morcheeba were an English electronic band, consisting of vocalist Skye Edwards and the brothers Paul and Ross Godfrey.
        They mix influences from trip hop, rock, folk-rock and downtempo, and have produced eight regular studio albums since 1995,
        two of which reached the UK top ten.[1] Their last studio album, Head Up High, was released in October 2013.[2]
        Edwards left the band in 2003, after which the brothers used a number of singers before she rejoined in 2009.
        They recruit additional members for their live performances and have toured internationally.
        In 2014 Paul Godfrey resigned from the band, thus ending Morcheeba.
        Edwards and Ross Godfrey later formed Skye|Ross and released a self-titled album in September 2016.[3]
